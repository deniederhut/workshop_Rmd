# This is a slide break
## This is a new slide
### This is a subheading

## Within a slide, you can have plain text

1. As a numbered list
2. That goes on
3. As long as you like
    
- Or as a bulleted list
    - With sublists

[Or a link that will open separately in a web browser](dlab.berkeley.edu)

Or just plain text with *italics*, **boldface**, ~subscript~, ^superscript^, and ~~strikethrough~~

## Within a slide, you can have code

Inline code is created by putting a `single back tick` on each end of the code

```
Code blocks are created with three back ticks above and below
```

Note that, as written, these will not actually run anything

## Within a slide, you can have a picture

The image source can be local or remote, but Rmd does not currently allow you to resize

## Within a slide, you can have a table

Table Name | Col 1 Name | Col 2 Name
-----------|------------|-----------
Row 1 Name | (1,1)      | (1,2)
Row 2 Name | (2,1)      | (2,2)


This will still format correctly even if you don't add the extra whitespace to make everything line up - they're only there to make it more human readable. If you don't want to have a table name, you'll need to bracket the left and right sides of each row with |

## Within a slide, you can evaluate code

```{r}
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
summary(model)
```

## Within a slide, you can create a plot

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=5,fig.width=7}
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1)
title(main = "cars data")
```
