```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# I like to use an initial batch of r code to load packages, import data, and do any 
# other formatting that doesn't need to be seen by your audience. If there are important
# data processings steps that you want to talk about, this is not the place to put them.
 options(warn=-1)
# When your presentation is ready to roll, uncomment the preceeding line to globally
# suppress any warnings about errors in your code. Note that if you go back to change
# something and it messes up a bunch of stuff, you won't get any warnins about the unholy
# havoc you have just wrought.

## Rmd is an easy way to generate documents

```{r}
model <- t.test(x=dat$variable.4[dat$variable.3 == 'Giant'], 
                y=dat$variable.4[dat$variable.3 == 'Sandwich'])
```

"An independent samples t test showed the groups were not significantly different, t = ```r model$statistic[[1]]```, df = ```r model$parameter[[1]]```, p = ```r model$p.value[[1]]```"

Unnecessary table | group 1 | group 2
------------------|---------|---------
Mean | ```r model$estimate[[1]]``` | ```r model$estimate[[2]]```

## Rmd is an easy way to be reproducible

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.height=6,fig.width=8}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x=variable.1,y=variable.2)) + geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = lm) + ggtitle("Dramatic and concluive statement")
```

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 1

The title of a document is separated by dashed lines:

```
Audacious title for your document and/or presentation
---
```

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 2

Headings follow the markdown standard hierarchy, with a slight modifications for presentations

```
# Heading 1 (slide interrupt)
## Heading 2 (slide title)
### Heading 3 (subtitle)
and so on ...
```

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 3

Text can be given basic formatting

```
*italics*
**bold**
~subscript~
^superscript^
```

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 4

Code can be echoed and evaluated

```
{r} 2 + 2
```

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 5

Plots can be embedded, with the generative code hidden

```
{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(data)
```

## You don't have to take my word for it

- In the repo, you should see a file called 'your_script.R'
- Open this in RStudio
- Create a new Rmd document by following the instructions in the docstring
- WARNING: I was a litle dishonest in my presentation
    - Look carefully at the code I used, especially the parts that were not echoed in presentation
    - See if you can tell a different story about what the data might really mean
