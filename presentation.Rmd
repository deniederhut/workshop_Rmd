## Overview

# When should you use Rmd?

## Rmd is an easy way to write

```{r}
model <- t.test(x=dat$variable.4[dat$variable.3 == 'Giants'], 
                y=dat$variable.4[dat$variable.3 == 'Athletics'])
```

"An independent samples t test showed the teams were not significantly different in their number of homeruns so far this year, t = `r model$statistic[[1]]`, df = `r model$parameter[[1]]`, p = `r model$p.value[[1]]`"

Homeruns | Giants | Athletics
------------------|---------|---------
Mean | `r model$estimate[[1]]` | `r model$estimate[[2]]`

## Rmd is an easy way to be reproducible

## Rmd is an easy way to open access

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.height=5,fig.width=7}
ggplot(data = dat, aes(x=variable.1,y=variable.2)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = lm) + 
  xlab('Thousands of dollars of debt') + ylab('Number of dates so far this year') + 
  ggtitle("Positive correlation between debts and dates")
```

## Rmd is not good for presenting media

# How do you use R markdown?

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 1

Chunks of code in Rmd are embedded with backticks:

![1](1.png)

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 2

You can evaluate the code chunk by adding {r}:

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 3

You can suppress the code itself by adding echo=FALSE:

![3](3.png)

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 3

You can evaluate code within a line by using a single backtick

![4](4.png)

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 4

The title of a document is separated by dashed lines:

```
Audacious title for your document and/or presentation
---
```

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 5

Headings follow the markdown standard hierarchy, with a slight modifications for presentations

```
# Heading 1 (slide interrupt)
## Heading 2 (slide title)
### Heading 3 (subtitle)
and so on ...
```

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 6

Text can be given basic formatting

```
*italics*
**bold**
~subscript~
^superscript^
```

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 7

Tables are constructed with dashes and pipes, and format automatically

## Basics of Rmd formatting pt 8

Links and are embedded using `[name](location)` and images are embedded using `![name](location)`

# Getting started with Rmd

## Obtaining the necessary materials

If you haven't already, go to:

[github.com/deniederhut/workshop_Rmd](github.com/deniederhut/workshop_Rmd)

- Github is a website for sharing and collaborating

- You can download the code for this workshop as a .zip, or you can clone it with HTTPS or SSH

- You should see cheat sheets in Rmd and HTML, along with a data file, this presentation, and a file called your_script.R

## Getting started in RStudio

- Open the .R script by going to File/Open File and selecting your_script.R

- You will see an .R script containing the same analysis you saw in this presentation

- Open a new .Rmd document by going to New File/Markdown, and selecting Document, then HTML

## Creating your first document pt 1

- Let's start by editing `title`, `author`, and `date` to appropriate values

- If you are creating a document, these will be in the header

- If you are creating a presentation, these will become the title slide

- If you want to make a slide deck instead of a document, you can change `html_document` to `ioslides_presentation`

- Try clicking the `Knit HTML` button to see how things look so far

## Creating your first document pt 2

- The people who want to read your document probably don't need to see the basic setup stuff

- You still need to put it in your document, but can suppress it with the `echo=FALSE` option

![7](7.png)

## Creating your first document pt 3

- Now let's put a little bit of basic information in your document

- You want these code chunks to echo and evaluate, so make sure you include `{r}` when you copy the code over

- We can also put graphs into your document

- Try copying over one of the `qplot` function calls in a code chunk that does not echo

## Creating your first document pt 4

- Keep copy-and-pasting the rest of the .R script into your new Rmd document

- One of the benefits of being open about your methods is that it makes it easy to catch mistakes that might significantly change your analysis

- I purposively made a small mistake when I put together this presentation

- For 10 pts extra credit:

    - Look carefully at the code I used, especially the parts that were not echoed in presentation
    - See if you can tell a different story about what the data might really mean
